# expiring-hash-map
Implementation of an expiring hash map which makes expired entries available.

As far as I can tell, the Java standard library does not contain a data structure that offers this feature. I searched elsewhere and couldn't find exactly what I needed either. Perhaps this will be of use to someone else.
